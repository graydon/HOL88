\SYNOPSIS
Test a function to ensure that it returns the expected values.

\LIBRARY basen

\DESCRIBE
Its inputs are:
  f             a function to test
  f\_name        the name of that function as a string
  relation      a function that compares the input, the actual output, and
                the expected output and returns true if the actual output
                was correct
  test\_cases    a list of triples, each of which is a test case, consisting
                of a string that identifies the test case and is to be printed
                out in case of failure, an input, and an expected output.
If the function signals failure when given the input on a test case, that test
case is considered to have failed.  If all test cases pass, the output is nil.
If any test case fails, a list is printed of the identification strings of all
failing test cases, and then the whole function fails.

\FAILURE
None.

\EXAMPLE
{
#let increment x = x + 1;;
increment = - : (int -> int)

#sanity_test increment `increment` relation [
        `test 1: increment zero`,
                0,      1;
        `test 2: increment one`,
                1,      3;
        `test 3: increment a relatively small number`,
                20,     21;
        `test 4: increment causing a carry`,
                9,      13;
        `test 5: increment a large number`,
                999999, 1000000 ]
where relation input actual expected =
  actual = expected;;

\COMMENTS
{sanity_test} cannot be used to test the failure behaviour of a function.  It
should be replaced by something that can.
