\TYPE {BASEN_GT_CONV : term -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Given a term comparing two numerals, returns a theorem saying whether one is
greater than the other.

\LIBRARY basen

\DESCRIBE
Given a term of the form {"BASEN r [...] > BASEN r [...]"}, returns a theorem
of the form {|- (BASEN r [...] > BASEN r [...]) = b}, where {b} is {"T"} or
{"F"}.

\FAILURE
The argument must be of the expected form, and the radix of the two numerals
must be the same, and the radix must be a numeric constant that is at least
2, and all elements of the digit lists must be numeric constants, and must be
less than the radix.

\EXAMPLE
{
#BASEN_GT_CONV "BASEN 16 [8;10;14] > BASEN 16 [12;4]";;
|- (BASEN 16[8;10;14]) > (BASEN 16[12;4]) = T
}
