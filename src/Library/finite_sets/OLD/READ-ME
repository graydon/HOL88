    mk_sets.ml 	       defines theory sets.th and proves properites about
                       sets 

    card.ml            defines cardinality (added by Philippe Leveilley)

    sets.ml            loads the library into hol

 TO REBUILD THE LIBRARY:						

   1) edit the pathnames in the Makefile (if necessary)

   2) type "make clean"

   3) type "make all"


 TO USE THE LIBRARY:							

   load_library `sets`;;

This makes the theory `sets` a new parent if you are in draft mode,
or loads the theory otherwise.
