NOTE CONCERNING REVISIONS TO THE finite_sets LIBRARY
----------------------------------------------------

The finite_sets library has been completely rewritten for HOL88
version 2.01.  In particular, the library has been made as exactly
parallel as possible to the sets and pred_sets libraries, with the
same names for theorems, the same form of definitions, and a similar
manual.

Users of older versions of the library should note that:

   * the MK_SET mechanism has been deleted 
   * some of the function constants have been made infixes
   * the constant INTERSECT is now called INTER
   * there are the following rough correspondences between
     the old and new theorems and definitions
