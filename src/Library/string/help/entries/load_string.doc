\DOC load_string

\TYPE {load_string : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads ML functions in the string library and sets up autoloading of theorems in
the library.

\DESCRIBE
If the user is not in draft mode, or the current theory is not an ancestor of
the library theory {string}, then the contents of the string library cannot
immediately be made available when the library is loaded, since the theory
{string} can neither be made a parent of the current theory nor loaded using
{load_theory}. In this case, the library load sequence defines the function
{load_string}. Calling this function when the library theory {string} is an
ancestor of the current theory completes the library load sequence for the
string library, making available the ML functions in the library and activating
autoloading of theorems.

\FAILURE
Fails if the theory {string} is not an ancestor of the current theory.
