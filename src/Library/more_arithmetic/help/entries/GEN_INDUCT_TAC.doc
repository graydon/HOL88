\TYPE {GEN_INDUCT_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs tactical proof by general mathematical induction on the natural numbers.

\DESCRIBE
{GEN_INDUCT_TAC} reduces a goal {!n.P}, where {n} has type {num}, to two
subgoals corresponding to the base and step cases in a proof by general mathematical induction on {n}. The induction hypothesis appears among the assumptions of the
subgoal for the step case.  The specification of {GEN_INDUCT_TAC} is:
{
                          A ?- !n. P
   ========================================================  GEN_INDUCT_TAC
    A ?- P[0/n]     A u {{!m. m < n' ==> P[m/n]}} ?- P[n'/n]
}
\noindent where {n'} is a primed variant of {n} that does not appear free in
the assumptions {A} (usually, {n'} just equals {n}). When {GEN_INDUCT_TAC} is
applied to a goal of the form {!n.P}, where {n} does not appear free in {P},
the subgoals are just {A ?- P} and {A u {{!m. m < n' ==> P}} ?- P}.

\FAILURE
{GEN_INDUCT_TAC g} fails unless the conclusion of the goal {g} has the form
{!n.t},
where the variable {n} has type {num}.
