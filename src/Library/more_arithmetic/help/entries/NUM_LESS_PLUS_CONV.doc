\DESCRIBE
When applied to terms of the form {"n"} and {"p < q"}, where
{n}, {p} and {q} have type {:num}, the conversion
{NUM_LESS_PLUS_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |-  p < q = (p + n) < (q + n)
}

\FAILURE
Fails if the first term does not have type {:num} or the second does not have
the form {"p < q"}.
