\TYPE {GEN_INDUCT_RULE : (thm -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs a proof by general mathematical induction on the natural numbers.

\KEYWORDS

\DESCRIBE
The derived inference rule {GEN_INDUCT_RULE} implements the rule of general
mathematical induction:
{
    A1 |- P[0/n]      A2 |- !n. (!m. m < n ==> P[m/n]) ==> P
   ----------------------------------------------------------  GEN_INDUCT_RULE
                        A1 u A2 |- !n. P
}
\noindent When supplied with a theorem {A1 |- P[0/n]}, which asserts the base
case of a proof of the proposition {P} by general induction on {n}, and the
 theorem
{
   A2 |- !n. (!m. m < n ==> P[m/n]) ==> P
}

\noindent which asserts the step case in the induction on
{n}, the inference rule {GEN_INDUCT_RULE} returns {A1 u A2 |- !n. P}.

\FAILURE
A call to {GEN_INDUCT_RULE th1 th2} fails if the theorems {th1} and {th2} do
 not have the forms
{A1 |- P[0/n]} and {A2 |- !n. (!m. m < n ==> P[m/n]) ==> P} respectively.
