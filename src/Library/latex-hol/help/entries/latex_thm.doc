\TYPE {latex_thm : (thm -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Translate \HOL\ theorems to \LaTeX\ format for typesetting.

\LIBRARY latex-hol

\DESCRIBE
The function {latex_thm} converts a \HOL\ theorem to \LaTeX\ format for
typesetting it. All \LaTeX\ special characters are escaped or changed
to a \LaTeX\ command which should produces the desired symbol. All
constants are tagged with the command {\CONST}. Numbers in variable
names are converted to subscripts. The
result is written to the user's terminal. 
For example,
{
# latex_thm INDUCTION;;
\THM \FORALL P\DOT
        P \,\CONST{0} \AND 
        (\FORALL n\DOT P \,n \IMP  P \,(\CONST{SUC} \,n)) \IMP 
           (\FORALL n\DOT P \,n)
() : void
}
The output of this function can be incorporated into a \LaTeX\
document. It should be put in one of the \LaTeX\ math modes, i.e.,
enclosed between a pair of {$}s or {\[ ... \]}. The macro file
{holmacs.tex} should be input before where the theorems appear.

\FAILURE
Fails if the argument is not an expression evaluated to having type {thm}.
