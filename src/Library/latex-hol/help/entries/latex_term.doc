\TYPE {latex_term : (term -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Translate \HOL\ terms to \LaTeX\ format for typesetting.

\LIBRARY latex-hol

\DESCRIBE
The function {latex_term} converts a \HOL\ term to \LaTeX\ format for
typesetting it. All \LaTeX\ special characters are escaped or changed
to a \LaTeX\ command which should produces the desired symbol.  All
constants are tagged with the command {\CONST}. Numbers in variable
names are converted to subscripts. The
result is written to the user's terminal. 
For example,
{
# latex_term "x1 /\ x2";;
"x_{1} \AND  x_{2}"
() : void

# latex_term "F ==> anything";;
"\CONST{F} \IMP  anything"
() : void

}
The output of this function can be incorporated into a \LaTeX\
document. They are usually in one of the math modes. The macro file
{holmacs.tex} should be input before where the terms appear.

\FAILURE
Fails if the argument is not a term.
