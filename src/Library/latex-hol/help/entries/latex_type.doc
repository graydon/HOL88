\TYPE {latex_type : (type -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Translate \HOL\ types to \LaTeX\ format for typesetting.

\LIBRARY latex-hol

\DESCRIBE
The function {latex_type} converts a \HOL\ type to \LaTeX\ format for
typesetting it. All \LaTeX\ special characters are escaped or changed
to a \LaTeX\ command which should produces the desired symbol.  The
result is written to the user's terminal. 
For example,
{
# latex_type(":* # **");;
":* \# **"
() : void

# latex_type(type_of"SUC");;
":num -> num"
() : void
}
The output of this function can be incorporated into a \LaTeX\
document. Since types are usually printed in {typewriter} font, the
above output can be put into a document as follows:
{
   The type of {SUC} is {\tt ":num -> num"} while a generic
   pair has type {\tt ":* \# **"}.
}
This will produces: The type of {SUC} is {":num -> num"} while a generic
pair has type {":* \# **"}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the argument is not a type.
