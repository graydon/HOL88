\TYPE {latex_theorems_to : (string -> (string -> thm) -> string list -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Translate \HOL\ theorems to \LaTeX\ format for typesetting.

\LIBRARY latex-hol

\DESCRIBE
This function converts a list of theorems into \LaTeX\ format. The
result is written into a file whose name is specified as the first
argument. The second argument is a function which maps a string to a
theorem. It is used to fetch the theorem given its name as a string.
The last argument is a list of strings which are the names of the
theorems to be converted to \LaTeX. Each theorem in the output file is
enclosed by two lines. The line before the theorem contains the string
value of the assignable ML identifier {latex_thm_tag} appended with
the name string of the theorem. the line after the theorem contains
the string value of the assignable ML identifier {latex_thm_end}. The
values of these ML identifiers can be changed by the user to suit his/her
requirements. The example below creates a file named {foo.i} which
contains two theorems in \LaTeX\ format:
{
# latex_theorems_to `foo.i` (\s. theorem `list` s)
# [`LENGTH_NIL`; `LENGTH_MAP`];;
() : void
}
Provided {latex_thm_tag} has been bound to the string {`@t `} and
{latex_thm_end} to {`@e`}, the file {foo.i} looks like:
{
@t LENGTH_NIL
\THM \FORALL l\DOT (\CONST{LENGTH} \,l = \CONST{0}) = (l = \NIL )
@e
@t LENGTH_MAP
\THM \FORALL l \,f\DOT
        \CONST{LENGTH} \,(\CONST{MAP} \,f \,l) = \CONST{LENGTH} \,l
@e
}
The purpose of this file is to create a file containing all the
theorems required in a document. This file can then be processed
automatically to incorporate the theorems into the document.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
