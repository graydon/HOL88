\TYPE {latex_theory_to : (string -> bool -> string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Translate \HOL\ theories to \LaTeX\ format for typesetting.

\LIBRARY latex-hol

\DESCRIBE
This function converts a theory to \LaTeX\ format for typsetting. The
result is written to a file whose name is specified as the first
argument. If such a file already exists, it is overwritten,
otherwise, a file having the given name is created. The second
argument specifies whether the output can be included in a larger
\LaTeX\ document. If it is {true}, the output can be included in a
document, otherwise, the ouput can be formatted as a standalone
document. The last argument specifies the name of the theory to be
processed. For example,
{
# latex_theory_to `bool.tex` false `bool`;;
() : void
}
\noindent creates a file named {bool.tex} which can then be formatted using the
command {latex bool}. This will produce a pretty printed copy of the
\HOL\ theory {bool}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
