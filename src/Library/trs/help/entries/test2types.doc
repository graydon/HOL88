\TYPE {test2types : ((type -> type -> bool) -> type -> type -> thmpattern)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function for generating a side-condition test from a predicate.

\LIBRARY trs

\DESCRIBE
{test2types} takes a predicate and two types as arguments and produces a
side-condition test. The types are pattern variables. When the side-condition
comes to be applied, the pattern variables are looked up in the binding
created by the match. The bound objects are then fed to the predicate. The
side-condition succeeds or fails based on the Boolean result.

Note that user defined functions which indicate a failure to match by raising
an exception should do so with the string {`no match`}.

\FAILURE
Fails if either of the type arguments is not a type variable. May also cause a
failure to match, when used in a search, if either of the pattern variables do
not appear in the binding.
