This directory contains the first release of an inductive definitions package
for HOL.  There is no manual at present, but preliminary documentation can be
found in the Manual directory.  Note that this is an initial release, and
at least following changes are proposed:

  * to add a function that maps rules as theorems to ML inference rules

  * to strengthen the implication proved by derive_cases_thm to equality

Please report any bugs or other problems to me.
