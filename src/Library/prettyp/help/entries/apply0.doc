\TYPE {apply0 : (* -> (string # int) list -> print_binding -> *)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function for constructing environment accessing functions.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{apply0} is a higher-order function which can be used to simplify the ML code
required for user-defined pretty-printer environment accessing functions.
Instead of having to mention the parameter list and binding explicitly as in:
{
   \params. \pbind. f
}
\noindent one can use {apply0}:
{
   apply0 f
}
\FAILURE
Cannot fail when given only one argument. However, the resulting function may
fail. This will depend on the value of the argument.

\EXAMPLE
A function for testing whether the parameter `{test}' has value 1 can be
written as:
{
   apply2 (curry $=) (bound_number `test`) (apply0 1)
}
\noindent instead of:
{
   \params. \pbind. (bound_number `test` params pbind) = 1
}
\noindent In this example it is not clear that use of {apply0} and {apply2} is
beneficial. However, it illustrates their usage.
