pp : (print_rule_function -> string -> (string # int) list ->
      print_tree -> void)
\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
One of the main pretty-printing functions. For use with the standard HOL
pretty-printer.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{pp} invokes the pretty-printer. It can be used for merging output with text
produced by the standard HOL pretty-printer. Instead of ending each line of
text by printing a new-line, it sends its output to the standard HOL printer
in the form of a pretty-printing block. The arguments to the function are:
(1) pretty-printing rules expressed as a function, (2) the initial context,
(3) initial parameters, (4) tree to be printed. {pp} uses as its maximum width
the width for the standard HOL printer, as specified by the function
{set_margin}. The initial offset from the left margin is taken to be zero.

\FAILURE
Failure or incorrect behaviour can be caused by mistakes in the pretty-printing
rules or by inappropriate arguments to the printing function. The most common
errors are use of uninitialised parameters and reference to unknown
metavariables. The latter are due to metavariables appearing in the format of a
rule, but not in the pattern. Errors also occur if a metavariable is used in a
place inappropriate for the value it is bound to. An example of this is an
attempt to compare a string with a metavariable that is bound to a tree rather
than a node-name.

Use of negative indentations in formats may cause text to overflow the left
margin, and an exception to be raised. Any user defined function may also
cause a run-time error.

The printing functions have been designed to trap exceptions and to print
{*error*}. This does not indicate what caused the error, but it may give some
indication of where the error occurred. However, this is not the main reason
for trapping exceptions. The ML directive {top_print} installs a user print
function. If an exception is raised within this function, it does not appear
at the top-level of ML. Instead, an obscure Lisp error is produced. Since the
pretty-printing functions are normally used with {top_print}, it is best to
avoid raising exceptions. For this reason the printing functions display
{*error*} instead.
