\TYPE {bound_number : (string -> print_int_exp)}

\SYNOPSIS
Obtains the value bound to a pretty-printer parameter.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{bound_number} takes the name of a pretty-printer parameter as its first
argument (a string) and returns a function of type:
{
   (string # int) list -> print_binding -> int
}
\noindent This function yields the integer value associated with the parameter,
when it is presented with an environment via its two arguments. The binding is
not used, but is present for consistency.

\FAILURE
The function fails if the parameter is not present in the parameter list.
