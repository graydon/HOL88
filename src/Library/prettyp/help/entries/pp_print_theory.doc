\DESCRIBE
{pp_print_theory} simulates the HOL system function {print_theory} using the
pretty-printer library. The function takes a theory-segment name as argument.
The following information is displayed: the parents of the theory, types
defined within the theory, constants of the theory, the binders and infixes
(subsets of the constants), the axioms, the definitions, and the derived
theorems.

\FAILURE
Fails if the named theory does not exist or is not an ancestor of the current
theory.
