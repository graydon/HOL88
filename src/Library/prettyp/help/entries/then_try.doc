\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
Function for composing print-rule functions.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{then_try} is an infix function which forms the composite of two print-rule
functions, say {prf1} and {prf2}. The result is a new print-rule function
which, when given a tree to match, first tries the rules of {prf1}; if none of
these match, it then tries the rules of {prf2}.

\FAILURE
Cannot fail when given two print-rule functions as arguments. However, the
resulting function may fail when used, with this depending on the failure
properties of the two argument functions.
