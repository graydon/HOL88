\TYPE {type_prec : (string -> int)}

\SYNOPSIS
Precedence table for HOL types (as a function).

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{type_prec} is a function which given the name of a HOL type operator, returns
the precedence used by the pretty-printer. The standard infix type operators
should be referred to by {fun}, {prod} and {sum}, rather than by the symbolic
forms.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
