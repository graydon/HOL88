\SYNOPSIS
Function for converting a HOL theorem into a print-tree.

\DESCRIBE
{pp_convert_all_thm} converts a theorem into a print-tree. The hypotheses
(assumptions) of the theorem are included in the print-tree. Instances of the
HOL constant {UNCURRY} in the theorem are converted into an appropriate use of
ordered pairs in the print-tree. The amount of type information included in
the print-tree is determined by the value of the HOL system flag {show_types}.
If {show_types} is {true}, then `useful' types are included in the print-tree.
Otherwise, only `hidden' types are included.

`Useful' type information is type information on the bound variables of
abstractions and on one occurrence of every free variable. Type information is
only included for constants if the constant is a function and it is not fully
applied.

`Hidden' types are rare. They only occur on variables which, although free,
without type information appear to be bound.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
