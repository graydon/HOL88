\SYNOPSIS
Function for constructing environment accessing functions.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{apply1} is a higher-order function which can be used to simplify the ML code
required for user-defined pretty-printer environment accessing functions.
Instead of having to mention the parameter list and binding explicitly as in:
{
   \params. \pbind. f (val params pbind)
}
\noindent one can use {apply1}:
{
   apply1 f val
}
\FAILURE
Cannot fail when given no more than two arguments. However, the resulting
function may fail. This will depend on the values of the arguments.

\EXAMPLE
Suppose a function is required which evaluates the length of the node-name
bound to the metavariable {***x}. The ML code for this is:
{
   \params. \pbind. (length o explode) (bound_name `x` params pbind)
}
\noindent The function takes a parameter list and a binding as arguments. It
uses these to find the node-name bound to the metavariable with name `{x}'. The
resulting string is then exploded into a list of single character strings and
the length of this list is computed. Using {apply1}, the code can be written
more simply as:
{
   apply1 (length o explode) (bound_name `x`)
}
