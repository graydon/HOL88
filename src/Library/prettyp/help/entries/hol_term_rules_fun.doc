\DOC hol_term_rules_fun

\TYPE {hol_term_rules_fun : print_rule_function}

\SYNOPSIS
Pretty-printing rules (as a function) for HOL terms. {hol_type_rules_fun} is
required for {hol_term_rules_fun} to function correctly.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\FAILURE
Fails if none of the rules match the input. However, this function should not
be applied `by hand'; it should only be used as an argument to one of the
pretty-printing functions.
