\DESCRIBE
{Hidden_types} is a value used to instruct the term-to-print-tree conversion
function as to how much type information to include in the tree. Type
information is only included for variables which, although free, without type
information appear to be bound. An example of such a variable is {"x:num"} in
the term:
{
   "\(x:bool). (x:num)"
}
\noindent Without types, this term appears as {"\x. x"}. However, the two
occurrences of {x} are different.
