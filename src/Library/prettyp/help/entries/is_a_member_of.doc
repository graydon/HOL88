\TYPE {$is_a_member_of : (string -> string list -> print_test)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function for testing a node-name metavariable in a pretty-printing rule.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{is_a_member_of} forms a {print_test} which yields {true} only if the
metavariable whose name is the first argument to {is_a_member_of} is bound to
a node-name which appears in the second argument. This evaluation to a Boolean
value is only performed when the {print_test} is applied to a parameter list
and a binding.

\FAILURE
The function fails if the metavariable named is bound to anything other than
a single node-name.

\EXAMPLE
An example of the use of this function is the rule:
{
   ''::***node(*,*) where
          {{`node` is_a_member_of [`plus`;`minus`;`mult`;`div`]}} ->
       [<h 0> ***node];
}
