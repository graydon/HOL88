\TYPE {bound_context : ((string # int) list -> print_binding -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Obtains the value of the current context from the pretty-printer environment.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
To make it easier to extract the value of the current context from its rather
contorted representation in the parameter list, there is a function called
{bound_context}. When presented with the current environment by way of its
arguments, {bound_context} returns the character string representing the
current context. The binding is not used, but is present for consistency.

\FAILURE
The function will not fail unless it is given an invalid parameter list.
