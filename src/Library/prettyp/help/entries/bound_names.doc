\SYNOPSIS
Obtains the node-names bound to a pretty-printer metavariable.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{bound_names} can be used to obtain the data item bound to a named
metavariable. It takes the name of a metavariable (less the preceding {*},
{**}, or {***}) as its first argument and returns a function of type:
{
   (string # int) list -> print_binding -> string list
}
\noindent When given the current environment as arguments, this function yields
the list of node-names bound to the specified metavariable. The parameter list
is not used, but is present for consistency.

\FAILURE
The function fails if the specified metavariable is not bound to a list of
node-names. It also fails if the metavariable cannot be found in the binding.
