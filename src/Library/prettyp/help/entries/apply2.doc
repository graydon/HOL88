\SYNOPSIS
Function for constructing environment accessing functions.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{apply2} is a higher-order function which can be used to simplify the ML code
required for user-defined pretty-printer environment accessing functions.
Instead of having to mention the parameter list and binding explicitly as in:
{
   \params. \pbind. f (val1 params pbind) (val2 params pbind)
}
\noindent one can use {apply2}:
{
   apply2 f val1 val2
}
\FAILURE
Cannot fail when given no more than three arguments. However, the resulting
function may fail. This will depend on the values of the arguments.

\EXAMPLE
A function for testing whether the parameter `{test}' has value 1 can be
written as:
{
   apply2 (curry $=) (bound_number `test`) (\params. \pbind. 1)
}
\noindent instead of:
{
   \params. \pbind. (bound_number `test` params pbind) = 1
}
\noindent In this example it is not clear that use of {apply2} is beneficial.
However, it illustrates its usage.
