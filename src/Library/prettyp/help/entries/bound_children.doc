\SYNOPSIS
Obtains the print-trees bound to a pretty-printer metavariable.

\DESCRIBE
{bound_children} can be used to obtain the data item bound to a named
metavariable. It takes the name of a metavariable (less the preceding {*},
{**}, or {***}) as its first argument and returns a function of type:
{
   (string # int) list -> print_binding -> print_tree list
}
\noindent When given the current environment as arguments, this function yields
the list of print-trees bound to the specified metavariable. The parameter
list is not used, but is present for consistency.

\FAILURE
The function fails if the specified metavariable is not bound to a list of
print-trees. It also fails if the metavariable cannot be found in the binding.
