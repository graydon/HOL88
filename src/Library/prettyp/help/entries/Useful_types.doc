Value used to control the amount of type information included in the print-tree
of a term.

\DESCRIBE
{Useful_types} is a value used to instruct the term-to-print-tree conversion
function to attach type information to the bound variables of abstractions,
and to one occurrence of every free variable. Type information is only
included for constants if the constant is a function and it is not fully
applied. So, the equals sign in {"1 = 2"} would not be adorned with type
information, but in {"$= 1"} it would be.

\SEEALSO
No_types, Hidden_types, All_types, term_to_print_tree.
