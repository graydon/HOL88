\TYPE {raw_tree_rules_fun : print_rule_function}

\SYNOPSIS
Pretty-printing rules (as a function) for raw print-trees (parse-trees).

\DESCRIBE
In the event of no pretty-printing rules matching the tree to be printed, a
default set of rules are used. These rules always match, and the output
generated is a textual representation of the structure of the tree. The default
rules are available to the user as {raw_tree_rules_fun}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
