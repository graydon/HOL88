\DOC Address

\TYPE {Address : (int list -> address)}

\SYNOPSIS
Type constructor for sub-tree addresses.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{Address il} denotes the address of a sub-tree within a tree. The integer
list {il} is the path that has to be followed from the root node of the tree
in order to reach the sub-tree.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The ML value {Address [1;2]} is the address within the tree:
{
         a
        / \
       b   c
      / \   \
     d   e   f
        / \
       g   h
}
\noindent of the sub-tree:
{
         e   
        / \
       g   h
}
\noindent The sub-tree is the second child of the first child of the main tree.

\USES
Sub-tree addresses are maintained as far as possible during the pretty-printing
process. They can thus be used to determine which sub-tree of the original
parse-tree was used to generate some specified part of the pretty-printed
text.
