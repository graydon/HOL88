\TYPE {bound_name : (string -> (string # int) list -> print_binding -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Obtains the node-name bound to a pretty-printer metavariable.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{bound_name} can be used to obtain the data item bound to a named metavariable.
It takes the name of a metavariable (less the preceding {*}, {**}, or {***}) as
its first argument and returns a function of type:
{
   (string # int) list -> print_binding -> string
}
\noindent When given the current environment as arguments, this function yields
the node-name bound to the specified metavariable. The parameter list is not
used, but is present for consistency.

\FAILURE
The function fails if the specified metavariable is not bound to a single
node-name. It also fails if the metavariable cannot be found in the binding.
