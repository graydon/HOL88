\SYNOPSIS
Function for transforming a print-tree bound to a metavariable.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
Within the metavariable transformation part of a pretty-printing rule, a
typical requirement is to `declare' a new metavariable to be bound to the
result of performing a transformation on a single existing metavariable. The
type of function required is:
{
   (string # int) list -> print_binding -> metavar_binding
}
\noindent There are four functions available to facilitate this, corresponding
to the four different types of data which can be bound to a metavariable.
{new_child} is the function for use when the data is a single print-tree.

The first argument is the transformation function. The second argument is the
name of the metavariable which is bound to the value to be transformed. When
provided with these arguments and a pretty-printer environment, {new_child}
extracts the item bound to the named metavariable and then applies the
transformation function to it. The result is then made into a form suitable
for binding to a metavariable, that is it is made into an object of type
{metavar_binding}.

\FAILURE
{new_child} fails if the named metavariable does not exist or is bound to an
item of the wrong type.
