pretty_print : (int -> int -> print_rule_function -> string ->
                (string # int) list -> print_tree -> void)
\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
One of the main pretty-printing functions. This one writes directly to the
terminal, independently of the standard HOL printer.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{pretty_print} invokes the pretty-printer. The arguments to this function are:
(1) maximum width of output permitted, (2) initial offset from left margin,
(3) pretty-printing rules expressed as a function, (4) the initial context,
(5) initial parameters, (6) tree to be printed.

\FAILURE
Failure or incorrect behaviour can be caused by mistakes in the pretty-printing
rules or by inappropriate arguments to the printing function. The most common
errors are use of uninitialised parameters and reference to unknown
metavariables. The latter are due to metavariables appearing in the format of a
rule, but not in the pattern. Errors also occur if a metavariable is used in a
place inappropriate for the value it is bound to. An example of this is an
attempt to compare a string with a metavariable that is bound to a tree rather
than a node-name.

Use of negative indentations in formats may cause text to overflow the left
margin, and an exception to be raised. Any user defined function may also
cause a run-time error.

The printing functions have been designed to trap exceptions and to print
{*error*}. This does not indicate what caused the error, but it may give some
indication of where the error occurred. However, this is not the main reason
for trapping exceptions. The ML directive {top_print} installs a user print
function. If an exception is raised within this function, it does not appear
at the top-level of ML. Instead, an obscure Lisp error is produced. Since the
pretty-printing functions are normally used with {top_print}, it is best to
avoid raising exceptions. For this reason the printing functions display
{*error*} instead.
