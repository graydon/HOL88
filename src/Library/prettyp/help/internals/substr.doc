\TYPE {substr : (int -> int -> string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function to obtain a sub-string of a string.

\LIBRARY prettyp

\DESCRIBE
{substr i l s} computes the sub-string of {s} beginning at the ({i+1})th
character and ending at the ({i+l})th character. So, the first {i} characters
are discarded, and the next {l} characters are taken as the sub-string.

\FAILURE
The function fails if the string is not long enough to meet the requirements.

\EXAMPLE
{
#substr 3 4 `abcdefghij`;;
`defg` : string

#substr 3 4 `abcdef`;;
evaluation failed     substr -- string too short
}
\COMMENTS
{substr} is an internal function of the `{prettyp}' library, but is of general
use.
