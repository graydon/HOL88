\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !p. t1 = t2}, the inference rule {MK_PSELECT}
returns the theorem {A |- (@x. t1) = (@x. t2)}.
{
       A |- !p. t1 = t2
   --------------------------  MK_PSELECT
    A |- (@p. t1) = (@p. t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is a singly paired universally quantified equation.
