\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !p. t1 = t2}, whose conclusion is a
paired universally quantified equation, {MK_PABS} returns the theorem
{A |- (\p. t1) = (\p. t2)}.
{
        A |- !p. t1 = t2
   --------------------------  MK_PABS
    A |- (\p. t1) = (\p. t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is a (singly) paired universally quantified equation.
