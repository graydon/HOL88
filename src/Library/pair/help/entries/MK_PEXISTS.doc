\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !p. t1 = t2}, the inference rule {MK_PEXISTS}
returns the theorem {A |- (?x. t1) = (?x. t2)}.
{
       A |- !p. t1 = t2
   --------------------------  MK_PEXISTS
    A |- (?p. t1) = (?p. t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is a singly paired universally quantified equation.
