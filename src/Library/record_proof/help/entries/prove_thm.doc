\TYPE {prove_thm : ((string # term # tactic) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove a boolean term using the supplied tactic, then save the
proof and the theorem.

\KEYWORDS
apply, proof recording.

\LIBRARY
record_proof

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a triple {(s,tm,tac)}, giving the name to
save the theorem under, the term to prove (with no assumptions) and the tactic
to perform the proof, the function {prove_thm} attempts to prove the goal
{?- tm}, that is, the term {tm} with no assumptions, using the tactic {tac}. If
{prove_thm} succeeds, it stores the proof in the current proof file,
and then attempts to save the resulting theorem in the current 
theory segment, and if this succeeds, the saved theorem is returned.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not of type {bool} (and so cannot possibly be
the conclusion of a theorem), or if the tactic cannot solve the goal.
In the latter case {prove_thm} will list the unsolved goals to help the user.
In addition, {prove_thm} will fail if the theorem cannot be saved, e.g. because
there is already a theorem of that name in the current theory segment, or if
the resulting theorem has assumptions; clearly this can only happen if the
tactic was invalid, so this gives some measure of validity checking.
