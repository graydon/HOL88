\TYPE {write_env : string -> void}

\KEYWORDS
proof recording.

\LIBRARY
record_proof

\SYNOPSIS
Output the current proof environment to a port.

\DESCRIBE
A proof is a list of inference steps.  The proof recorder records
every inference performed by the system in an internal buffer.
When a proof is completed, the raw records are converted into a list
of proof lines as in Hilbert's style proofs. These lines are then
output to a disk file. This file is in the {prf} format specified in
[1]. A proof is performed in an environment. It consists of a set of
type operators and a set of constants.

{write_env} is the output function for writing the current proof
environment to a 
output port. The first argument is a string representing a port. It
should be the value returned by the system function {openw}.


\FAILURE
Never fail.

\COMMENTS
This function is used to implement higher level user functions for
recording proof in the library {record_proof}. It is much more
convenient to use those functions than this low level function directly.
