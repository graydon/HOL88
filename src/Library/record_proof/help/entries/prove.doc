\TYPE {prove : ((term # tactic) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove a boolean term using the supplied tactic and saves the proof.

\KEYWORDS
apply, proof recording.

\LIBRARY
record_proof

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term-tactic pair {(tm,tac)}, the function {prove} attempts to
prove the goal {?- tm}, that is, the term {tm} with no assumptions, using the
tactic {tac}. If {prove} succeeds, it saves the proof in the current proof
file and returns the corresponding theorem
{A |- tm}, where the assumption list {A} may not be empty if the tactic is
invalid; {prove} has no inbuilt validity-checking.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term is not of type {bool} (and so cannot possibly be
the conclusion of a theorem), or if the tactic cannot solve the goal.

\COMMENTS
The function {PROVE} provides almost identical functionality, and will
also list unsolved goals if the tactic fails. It is therefore preferable
for most purposes.
