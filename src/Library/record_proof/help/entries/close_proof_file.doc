\TYPE {close_proof_file : void -> void}

\KEYWORDS
proof recording.

\LIBRARY
record_proof

\SYNOPSIS
Close the current proof file.

\DESCRIBE
A proof is a list of inference steps.  The proof recorder records
every inference performed by the system in an internal buffer.
When a proof is completed, the raw records are converted into a list
of proof lines as in Hilbert's style proofs. These lines are then
output to a disk file. This file is in the {prf} format specified in
[1].  A proof file may contain one or more of proofs.

The function {close_proof_file} closes the current proof file which
has been opened by calling the function {new_proof_file}. Since the
size of the proof file is very large, it will be automatically
compressed. The name of the compressed file obtained by appending the
suffix {.gz} to the original name.


\FAILURE
Fails if not proof file is currently opened.

\EXAMPLE
Below is an example showing the use of this function to record a simple
proof:
{
#new_theory`THY`;;
() : void

#new_proof_file`myproof`;;
() : void

#prove_thm(`ADD_0`,
#  "!m. m + 0 = m",
#   INDUCT_TAC THEN ASM_REWRITE_TAC[ADD]);;
|- !m. m + 0 = m

#close_proof_file ();;
() : void
}
