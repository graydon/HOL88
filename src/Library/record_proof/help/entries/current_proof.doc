\TYPE {current_proof : void -> string}

\KEYWORDS
proof recording.

\LIBRARY
record_proof

\SYNOPSIS
Get the name of the current proof.

\DESCRIBE
A proof is a list of inference steps.  The proof recorder records
every inference performed by the system in an internal buffer.
When a proof is completed, the raw records are converted into a list
of proof lines as in Hilbert's style proofs. These lines are then
output to a disk file. This file is in the {prf} format specified in
[1]. A proof file may contain one or more of proofs.

The function {current_proof} returns the name of the current proof.
A null string indicates no proof is currently in progress.

\FAILURE
Never fail.

\EXAMPLE
Below is an example showing the use of this function:
{
#new_proof_file `myproof`;;
() : void

#let th = SPEC_ALL ADD_SYM;;
Theorem ADD_SYM autoloading from theory `arithmetic` ...
ADD_SYM = |- !m n. m + n = n + m

th = |- m + n = n + m

#let v = genvar ":num";;
"GEN%VAR%536" : term

#begin_proof`proof1`;;
() : void

#let th1 = (REFL "SUC(m + n)");;
th1 = |- SUC(m + n) = SUC(m + n)

#current_proof ();;
`proof1` : string

#let th2 = SUBST [th,v] "SUC(m + n) = SUC ^v" th1;;
th2 = |- SUC(m + n) = SUC(n + m)

#end_proof();;
() : void

#current_proof();;
() : void
}
