\DESCRIBE

When applied to a goal, {A ?- t}, the function goal_frees returns a list,
without repetitions, of those variables which are free either in t or in
some member of the assumption list A.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
When applied to the goal {(SUC m) < (SUC n) ?- m < n}
goal_frees returns the list {["m"; "n"]}. The term {SUC} is a
constant, not a variable, so that is not included.
