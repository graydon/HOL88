\TYPE {open_TAC : (path -> thm list -> (window -> window) -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Do some window inference on the current goal of the subgoals package.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{open_TAC path thms fn} is a tactic will allows the window inference system
to be called from within the subgoals package.
A subwindow is opened on that subterm of the goal, {goal}, selected by {path}.
The window will have the assumptions of the goal as it's assumptions, as
well as any assumptions which follow from it's context.
The window will have {thms} as it's set of relevant theorems.
The relation preserved by the subwindow is chosen so that transforming the
subwindow, with {fn}, transforms {goal} to {goal'}, generating the theorem
{(H |- goal' ==> goal')}.
The subwindow is then closed and the goal is transformed from {goal} to
{goal'}.

\FAILURE
{open_TAC path thms fn} will fail if the goal stack is empty or if
{path} denotes a position which is not present in the current goal.

\EXAMPLE
{
   #set_goal ([], "A \/ (B \/ F)");;
   "A \/ B \/ F"
   
   () : void
   
   #e (open_TAC [RAND] [] (rewrite_win []));;
   OK..
   "A \/ B"
   
   () : void
}
