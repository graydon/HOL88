\DOC UNDO

\TYPE {UNDO: (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Undoes the last transformation made to the current window stack.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE

Every change made to the current window stack is stored in a history.
The most recent {n} states of the stack can be retrieved by 
sucessive calls to the {UNDO} command 
({n} is the number returned by {GET_MAX_HIST}).
Undoing a window with the {UNDO_WIN} command counts as a change
to the stack, and can therefore be undone with {UNDO}.
An {UNDO}, or seqence of {UNDO}s, can be undone by a {REDO}, or
sequence of {REDO}s.

\FAILURE
{UNDO ()} will fail if no transformations have been made to the stack.
