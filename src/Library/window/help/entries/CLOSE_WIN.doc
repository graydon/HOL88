\DOC CLOSE_WIN

\TYPE {CLOSE_WIN : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Pop the top window from the stack and transform the parent window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{CLOSE_WIN ()} removes the top window from the window stack and
uses the theorem in that window to transform the parent window.
{CLOSE_WIN} is used to close subwindows opened by the
{GEN_OPEN_WIN}, {OPEN_WIN}, {OPEN_CONTEXT} and {ESTABLISH} commands.

\FAILURE
{CLOSE_WIN ()} will fail if the stack is empty or is only one
window deep.
Other possible failures depend on the command used to open the window.

\EXAMPLE
{
#BEGIN_STACK `example` "(==>) (A /\ (B /\ F))" [] [];;
==> * A /\ B /\ F
() : void

#OPEN_WIN [rand];;
    ! A
==> * B /\ F
() : void

#REWRITE_WIN [];;
    ! A
==> * F
() : void

#CLOSE_WIN [];;
==> * A /\ F
() : void
}
