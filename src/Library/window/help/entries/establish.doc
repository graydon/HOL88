\TYPE {establish : (term -> (window -> window) -> window -> window)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prove a new lemma.
(Also used to establish the truth of conjectures.)

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{establish tm fn win} opens a subwindow with focus {tm}.
If {tm} is a conjecture in the parent window,
it (and any lemmas that depend on it) will be removed from the subwindow.
The relationship preserved in the subwindow is {"==>"}.
{fn} is then used to transform the focus of the subwindow from {tm} to
{"T"}(true).
The subwindow is then closed and {tm} becomes a lemma in the parent window.
The parent window with the new lemma is returned as the result.

\FAILURE
{establish tm fn win} will fail if {fn} does not transform {tm} to {"T"} in
the subwindow.
