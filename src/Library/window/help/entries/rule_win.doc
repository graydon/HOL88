\DESCRIBE
Assuming {RULE} is an inference rule of the following form:
{
    H |- c
   -------- RULE
    H |- c'
}
\noindent {rule_win RULE} can be used to transform the focus of a window
from {c} to {c'}, providing the window is supposed to preserve {"<=="} or
some weaker relation.

\FAILURE
{rule_win r} will fail if the window is not supposed to preserve some
relation which is equal to or weaker than {"<=="}.
