\TYPE {filter_asm_rewrite_win : ((term- bool)->thm list->window->window)}

\SYNOPSIS
Selectively rewrite the focus with context, theorems and basic rewritings.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{filter_asm_rewrite_win p thms} repeatedly rewrites the focus of a
window with {thms}, a list of basic rewritings and those theorems in
the context of the window, the conclusions of which satisfy the predicate
{p}.

\FAILURE
{filter_asm_rewrite_win p thms} will fail if the hypotheses of any of the 
theorems in {thms} are not a subset of the conjectures of the window.
This function may fail to terminate if {thms}, or the selected terms
in the context, describe a circular rewriting.
