\TYPE {load_window : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Finishes loading the window library.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE

If when the user attempts to load the window library the system is
unable to load the theory {win}, then loading is aborted and the function
{load_window} defined.
If at some later time the user loads the theory {win} or places the system
in draft mode, then the call {load_library ()} can be used to complete
the loading of the window library.

\COMMENTS
The function {load_window} is only defined if the initial attempt to load
the window library did not succeed.

\FAILURE
Fails if the theory {win} is not the parent theory
and the system is not in draft mode.
