\TYPE {hypotheses : (window -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
The set of hypotheses of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
This is the list of things that may be assumed in the context of a window.
{hypotheses} may not present these things in the same way as they are
printed interactively.   Use {disp_hyposesthese} to get the set of
hypotheses that are printed for interactive use.

\EXAMPLE
{
   #BEGIN_STACK `hyp-ex` "= ((A /\ B) /\ C)" [] [];;
   = * (A /\ B) /\ C
   () : void

   #OPEN_WIN [RAND];;
     ! B
     ! A
   = * C
   () : void
   
   #hypotheses (TOP_WIN ());;
   ["A /\ B"] : term list
}

\FAILURE
Never fails.
