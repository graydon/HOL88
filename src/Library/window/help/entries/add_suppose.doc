\SYNOPSIS
Add a supposition to the set associated with a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{add_suppose (p ?- c)} adds the supposition {(p ?- c)} to the set of
suppositions associated with a window.
The supposition will not be added if some stronger 
(equivalent conclusion, subset of assumptions) theorem or supposition is
already held by the window.
A limited amount of resolution is also performed on the theorems and
supposition of a window after each addition.
For example, if {(q ?- p)} were already a supposition 
and the supposition {(p ?- c)} was added, then the supposition {(q ?- c)}
would be inferred.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
