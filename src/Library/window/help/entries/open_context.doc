\TYPE {open_context : (term -> path -> (window -> window) -> window -> window)}

\SYNOPSIS
Derive a new lemma by applying a transformation to a subwindow on
one of the assumptions, lemmas or conjectures.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{open_context tm path fn win} opens a subwindow on the
assumption, lemma or conjecture {tm} at the position described by {path}.
The window transforming function {fn} is then applied to the resulting
subwindow.
The relationship preserved by the subwindow will be chosen so that
transforming the subwindow will transform {tm} to {tm'} generating the
theorem {.|- tm' <== tm}.
The subwindow is then closed thereby making {tm'} an additional lemma of
the parent window.
The parent window with its new lemma is returned as the result.

\FAILURE
{open_context tm path fn win} will fail if {tm} is not an assumption, lemma
or conjecture of {win}.
{open_context tm path fn win} will fail if {path} describes a position which
is not present in {tm}.
