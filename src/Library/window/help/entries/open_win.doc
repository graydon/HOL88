\DOC open_win

\TYPE {open_win : (path -> (window -> window) -> window -> window)}

\SYNOPSIS
Apply some transformation to a subwindow of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{open_win path fn win} opens a subwindow in the focus of {win} at the
position described by {path}.
The window transforming function {fn} is then applied to the resulting
subwindow.
The subwindow is then closed and the transformed parent window returned as
the result.

\FAILURE
{open_win path fn win} will fail if {path} describes a position which
is not present in the focus of {win}.

\EXAMPLE
{
   # transform "(==>) (A /\ (B /\ F))" [] []
   # (
   #       open_win [RAND]
   #       (
   #               rewrite_win []
   #       )
   # );;
   |- A /\ F ==> A /\ B /\ F
}
