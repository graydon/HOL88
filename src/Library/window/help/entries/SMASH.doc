\DESCRIBE
The operation of {SMASH} is similar to that of {CONJUNCTS} except that
it does not just break apart conjunctions.
{SMASH} recursively applies the following inference rules to a theorem
to smash it into a list of smaller theorems.
{
       H |- A /\ B         H |- ~(A \/ B)      H |- ~(A ==> B)
    -----------------    -------------------  ------------------
     H |- A   H |- B      H |- ~A   H |- ~B    H |- A   H |- ~B
                                                                   
     H |- ~(A <== B)      H |- A => B | F
    ------------------   -----------------
     H |- ~A   H |- B     H |- A   H |- B
}

\FAILURE
Never Fails.

\USES
Used in the assumption generating field of a window rule to smash a single
assumption into a list of assumptions.
