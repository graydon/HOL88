\DOC FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN

\TYPE {FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN : ((term -> bool) -> thm list -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly rewrite the focus with selected terms of the context and theorems.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} repeatedly rewrites the focus of 
of the top window on the current stack with {thms} and those theorems in the
context of the window, the conclusions of which satisfy the predicate {p}.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is not current stack.

{FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} will fail if the hypotheses of any of
the theorems in {thms} are not a subset of the conjectures of the window.
This function may fail to terminate if {thms}, or the selected terms in
the context, describe a circular rewriting.
