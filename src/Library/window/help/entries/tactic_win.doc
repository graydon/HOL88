\TYPE {tactic_win :  (tactic -> window -> window)}

\SYNOPSIS
Apply a tactic to the focus of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
Assuming {TAC} is an inference rule of the following form:
{
    P |- c
   ======== TAC
    P |- c'
}
\noindent {tactic_win TAC} can be used to transform the focus of a window
from {c} to {c'}, providing the window is supposed to preserve {"==>"} or
some weaker relation.

\FAILURE
{tactic_win t} will fail if the window is not supposed to preserve some
relation which is equal to or weaker than {"==>"} or if the
tactic produces multiple subgoals.
