\DESCRIBE
{GEN_OPEN_WIN wpath fn} opens a subwindow on the top window at the
position described by {wpath}.
{wpath} can take one of two forms.
If {wpath} is of the form {FOCUS p} then it indicates a subterm of the 
focus.
In such cases {GEN_OPEN_WIN wpth} behaves like {OPEN_WIN p}.
If {wpath} is of the form {CONTEXT_PATH (t,p)} then it indicates a subterm of
the context.
In such cases {GEN_OPEN_WIN wpth} behaves like {OPEN_CONTEXT t p}.
