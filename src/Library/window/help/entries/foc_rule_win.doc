\TYPE {foc_rule_win :  ((term -> thm) -> window -> window)}

\SYNOPSIS
Apply an inference rule to the focus of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
Assuming {RULE} is an inference rule of the following form:
{
   ------------- RULE "f"
    H |- f' R f
}
\noindent {foc_rule_win RULE} can be used to transform the focus of a window
from {f} to {f'}, providing the window is supposed to preserve {"R"} or
some weaker relation.

\COMMENTS
The actual type displayed by the system is ":(conv -> window -> window)".

\FAILURE
{rule_win r} will fail if the window is not supposed to preserve some
relation which is equal to or weaker than {"<=="}.
{rule_win r} will fail if the hypotheses of the theorem produced by {r}
are not a subset of the context of the window.
