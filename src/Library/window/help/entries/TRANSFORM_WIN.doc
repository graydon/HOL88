\DESCRIBE
{TRANSFORM_WIN (H |- F' R F)} is used to transform the focus of the
window on top of the window stack from {F} to {F'}.

\FAILURE
If {f} is not the focus of the top window, then 
{TRANSFORM_WIN (H |- F' R F)} will fail.
{TRANSFORM_WIN (H |- F' R F)} will fail if {H} is not a subset of the
context of the top window.
{TRANSFORM_WIN (H |- F' R F)} will fail if {R} is not equal to or
stronger than the relation that the top window is supposed to maintain.
