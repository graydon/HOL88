\TYPE {convert_win :  (conv -> window -> window)}

\SYNOPSIS
Apply a conversion to the focus of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
If the focus of the window, {win}, is {"f"}, and applying a conversion {c} to
{"f"} yields {(|- f = f')}, then {CONVERT_WIN c win} transforms the
focus of {win} from {"f"} to {"f'"}.

\FAILURE
{convert_win c win} will fail if the hypotheses of the theorem returned when
{c} is applied to the focus of the window are not a subset of the
context of {win}.
