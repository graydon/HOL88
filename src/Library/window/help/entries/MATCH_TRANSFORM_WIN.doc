\DOC MATCH_TRANSFORM_WIN

\TYPE {MATCH_TRANSFORM_WIN : (thm -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Transform the focus of the current window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{MATCH_TRANSFORM_WIN (H |- !x1...xn. g R f)} specialises the quantified
variables {x1} ... {xn} and then instantiates the free variables so that
{f} matches the focus of the current window.   The focus is then transformed to
{g} (with the same substitutions applied).

\FAILURE
{TRANSFORM_WIN (H |- g R f)} will fail if {f} can not be instantiated
to the focus of the window.
{TRANSFORM_WIN (H |- g R f)} will fail if {H} is not a subset of the
context of the window.
{TRANSFORM_WIN (H |- g R f)} will fail if {R} is not equal to or
stronger than the relation that the window is supposed to maintain.
