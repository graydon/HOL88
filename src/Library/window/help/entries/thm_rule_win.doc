\TYPE {thm_rule_win :  ((thm -> thm) -> window -> window)}

\SYNOPSIS
Apply an inference rule to the result of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
Assuming {RULE} is an inference rule of the following form:
{
      H |- fn R f
    ---------------- RULE
     H' |- fn' R' f
}
Then if {(thm_rule_win RULE)} is applied to a window holding the 
theorem {H |- fn R f}, it will transform the window to one which holds the
theorem {H' |- fn' R' f}, provided that {H'} is a subset of the context
of the window and {R'} is as strong as {R}.
This will effectively transform the focus from {fn} to {fn'}.

\FAILURE
{thm_rule_win r w} if {r (win_thm w)} is not of the form {H' |- fn' R' f}
(note that this requires that {r} does not change {f});
or if {H'} is not a subset of the context of the window, or {R'} is not as
strong as {R}.
