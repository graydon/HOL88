\DESCRIBE
Redoes the last change that was undone from the current stack.
Several {REDO}s can undo the effect of several {UNDO}s.
It is not possible to {REDO} more {UNDO}s than are stored in the stacks
history.   To find out how many states can be stored in a stack, use the
{GET_MAX_HIST} command.

\FAILURE
{REDO ()} will fail if nothing has been undone, or if some other
change has been made to the stack since the last {UNDO}.

\SEEALSO
UNDO, SET_MAX_HIST, GET_MAX_HIST
