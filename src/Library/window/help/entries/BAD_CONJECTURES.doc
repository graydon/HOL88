\DESCRIBE
{BAD_CONJECTURES ()} returns the set of conjectures which have been used
to transform the window on top of the window stack, and which are not
in the context of the parent window below.
These conjectures are called bad because the top window can not be closed
if it has any bad conjectures.

\FAILURE

\COMMENTS
If there is only one window on the window stack,
all of its used conjectures are considered bad.
