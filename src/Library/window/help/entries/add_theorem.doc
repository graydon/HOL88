\TYPE {add_theorem : (thm -> window -> window)}

\SYNOPSIS
Add a theorem to the set of theorems relevant to a window.

\DESCRIBE
{add_theorem (a |- c)} adds the theorem {(a |- c)} to the set of theorems
considered relevant to a window.
The theorem will not be added if a stronger 
(alpha-equivalent conclusion, fewer assumptions) theorem is already held
by the window.
When each theorem is added, a limited amount of resolution is performed.
For example if the theorem {(b |- a)} is already held by the system,
and the theorem {(a |- c)} was added, then the theorem {(b |- c)}
would be inferred.

\FAILURE
Never fails.
