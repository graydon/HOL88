\noindent hereafter referred to as `the User',
the \HOL\ proof assistant system, hereafter referred to as
`the Software', subject to the following terms:

\begin{enumerate}

\item 
The University of Edinburgh, the
University of Cambridge and Inria, hereafter referred to as `the Developers',
retain the copyright and all other legal
rights to those parts of the software that they respectively
developed, and they confirm that the sum of such parts constitute the whole.
The User will ensure that the software in all its derivations
carries a copyright notice of the form:
\begin{center}
\copyright\ University of Edinburgh,
\copyright\ University of Cambridge,
\copyright\ Inria
\end{center}


\item The User may employ the Software for any personal or internal purpose,
but not as part or whole of any system to be distributed for commercial gain.
The User shall be entitled to develop derivations of the Software and to make
the Software and its derivations available to others, without charge, for
research and for evaluating products developed by the User.

\item The User shall not declare theorems to have been proved using HOL unless
they were proved with an authorized version of the HOL system.  An executable
binary file supplied by the Developers, or built using a Makefile supplied by
them, constitutes an authorized version of HOL. Versions of HOL developed by
the User are not authorized unless so designated, in writing, by the
Developers.

\item The User will notify the University of Cambridge Computer
Laboratory, in writing, of any significant derivations of
the Software made by
the User. The User will also notify the University of Cambridge Computer
Laboratory, in writing, of all persons or organizations to whom such
derivations are distributed.

\item The Software is made available on an {\it as is\/} basis; no guarantee
of maintenance or reliability is provided by the Developers.

\item The User shall not hold the Developers
liable for any consequences arising from use of the
Software whether by himself or by any other party.
The User shall indemnify the Developers and their staff against any claim by
any third party arising from or in connection with the use of the Software,
other than a claim for copyright infringement.
