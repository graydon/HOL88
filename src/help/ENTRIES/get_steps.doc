\TYPE {get_steps : void -> step list}

\KEYWORDS
proof recording.


\SYNOPSIS
Get the proof steps since last time the proof recorder is enabled.

\DESCRIBE
A proof is a list of inference steps. After the proof recorder is
enabled, every inference performed by the system is recorded and
cumulated in an internal buffer. When a proof is completed, the raw
records can then be processed and output to a disk file.

{get_steps} is a low level user function for managing the proof
recorder. It returns the list of steps cumulated since last time the
proof recorder is enabled, i.e. the function {record_proof} is called
with the value {true}. The list of inference step needs to be
processed to produce a proof line list which can be output to a file.


\FAILURE
Never fail.

\EXAMPLE
Below is an example showing how to record an extremely simple proof
in which the function {get_steps} is called to get the list of
inference steps:
{
#let th = SPEC_ALL ADD_SYM;;
Theorem ADD_SYM autoloading from theory `arithmetic` ...
ADD_SYM = |- !m n. m + n = n + m

th = |- m + n = n + m

#let v = genvar ":num";;
"GEN%VAR%536" : term

#record_proof true;;
() : void

#let th1 = (REFL "SUC(m + n)");;
th1 = |- SUC(m + n) = SUC(m + n)

#let th2 = SUBST [th,v] "SUC(m + n) = SUC ^v" th1;;
th2 = |- SUC(m + n) = SUC(n + m)

#record_proof false;;
() : void

#write_proof_to `ap_term.prf` `ap_term` [] (get_steps());;
() : void
}
The proof consists of two inference steps: the application of the two
primitive inference rules {REFL} and {SUBST}. The function
{write_proof_to} outputs the proof into a file names {ap_term.prf}.

\COMMENTS
This function is used to implement higher level user functions for
recording proof in the library {record_proof}. It is much more
convenient to use those functions than the low level functions
such as {get_steps} directly.
