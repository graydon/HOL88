\TYPE {define_load_lib_function = - : (string list -> void -> void)}

\KEYWORDS
library

\SYNOPSIS
Defines a function for loading the contents of a library.

\DESCRIBE
 If a library is loaded while the system is not in draft mode, it may
 not be loaded completely.
 In such case, a function whose name is created by prefixing the name
 of the library with `{load_}' is defined. This function can be called
 later to complete the loading.

The function {define_load_lib_function} dynamically defines such a
function. It is called in the generic library loader {library_loader}.
Due to the way it is called using {let_before}, it can  take only a
single argument, a string list. The information passed in this list
consists of the library name, the names of theories and the names of
the code files. The library name is the first string in the list and
it is mandatory. The theory names and code file names follow, and they
are separated by a null string. Both of these are optional. E.g. the
simplest case is {[`lib_name`; ``]}.

When the loading function defined by {define_load_lib_function} is
called, the code files will be loaded, and the theorems and
definitions in the theories will be set up for autoloading.

\FAILURE
The function {define_load_lib_function} fails if called with an
argument not in the form described above.
The loading function defined by it will fail if any of the code files
cannot be loaded successfully, or any of the theories is not in the ancestry
of the current theory.
