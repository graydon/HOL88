\TYPE {resume_recording : void -> void}

\KEYWORDS
proof recording.


\SYNOPSIS
Suspend proof recording temporarily.

\DESCRIBE
A proof is a list of inference steps. After the proof recorder is
enabled, every inference performed by the system is recorded and
cumulated in an internal buffer. When a proof is completed, the raw
records can then be processed and output to a disk file.

{resume_recording} is a low level user function for managing the proof
recorder. It resumes the proof recorder without clearing the internal
inference step buffer.  The proof recorder should be in the suspended state.
Otherwise, this function does nothing.

The current state of the proof recorder can interrogated using the
function {is_recording_proof}. A value of {false} indicates the proof
recorder is disabled.

\FAILURE
Never fail.

\COMMENTS
This function is used to implement higher level user functions for
recording proof in the library {record_proof}. It is much more
convenient to use those functions than the low level functions
such as {resume_recording} directly.
