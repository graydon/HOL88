\TYPE {RecordStep : step -> void}

\KEYWORDS
proof recording.


\SYNOPSIS
Record a single inference step.

\DESCRIBE
A proof is a list of inference steps. After the proof recorder is
enabled, every inference performed by the system is recorded and
cumulated in an internal buffer. When a proof is completed, the raw
records can then be processed and output to a disk file.

{record_proof} is a system function for recording a single proof step.
The type {step} represents a basic inference step. It contains all
the necessary information of each inference. There are currently 52
basic inferences which are being recorded. All other ML functions
representing inference rules are implemented by these basic
inferences.
If the proof recorder is enabled when an inference is performed, 
{RecordStep} will add a step into the internal buffer. 

\FAILURE
Never fail.

\COMMENTS
This is a system function implementing the proof recorded. Users
should not use this function directly. User functions are provided in
the library {record_proof}.  When new basic inference rule
is implemented, this function should be called to record the inference step.
