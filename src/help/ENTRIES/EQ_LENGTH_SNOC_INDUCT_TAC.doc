\KEYWORDS

\DESCRIBE
{EQ_LENGTH_SNOC_INDUCT_TAC} reduces a goal
 {!x y . (LENGTH x = LENGTH y) ==> t[x,y]},
 where {x} and {y} range over lists, to two
subgoals corresponding to the base and step cases in a proof by 
induction on the length of {x} and {y}. The induction hypothesis appears among
the assumptions of the
subgoal for the step case.  The specification of {EQ_LENGTH_SNOC_INDUCT_TAC} is:
{
     A ?- !x y . (LENGTH x = LENGTH y) ==> t[x,y]
   ================================================  EQ_LENGTH_SNOC_INDUCT_TAC
                            A ?- t[NIL/x][NIL/y]
    A u {{LENGTH x = LENGTH y, t[x'/x, y'/y]}} ?- 
         !h h'. t[(SNOC h x)/x, (SNOC h' y)/y]
}

\FAILURE
{EQ_LENGTH_SNOC_INDUCT_TAC g} fails unless the conclusion of the goal {g} has the
 form 
{
   !x y . (LENGTH x = LENGTH y) ==> t[x,y]
}
\noindent  where the variables {x} and {y}
 have types {(xty)list} and {(yty)list} for some types {xty} and {yty}.
 It also fails if either of the variables {x} or {y} appear free in the
 assumptions. 

\USES
use this tactic when  structural induction is performed on two lists and
they have identical length.
