\TYPE {is_recording_proof : void -> bool}

\KEYWORDS
proof recording.


\SYNOPSIS
Get the current state of proof recorder.

\DESCRIBE
A proof is a list of inference steps. After the proof recorder is
enabled, every inference performed by the system is recorded and
cumulated in an internal buffer. When a proof is completed, the raw
records can then be processed and output to a disk file.

{is_recording_proof} is a low level user function for managing the proof
recorder. It returns {true} is the proof recording is currently enabled.
Otherwise, it returns {false}.

\FAILURE
Never fail.

\COMMENTS
This function is used to implement higher level user functions for
recording proof in the library {record_proof}. It is much more
convenient to use those functions than the low level functions
such as {is_recording_proof} directly.
