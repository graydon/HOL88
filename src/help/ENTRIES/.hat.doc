\TYPE {$^ : (string -> string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Concatenates two ML strings.

\KEYWORDS
string, join.

\DESCRIBE
The {^} is the ML infix string concatenation operator.
If {s1} and {s2} are strings, then {s1^s2} gives a string which is their
concatenation.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#`Hello `^`world`;;
`Hello world` : string
}
\COMMENTS
The ML role of the {^} operator should not be confused with its use in
quoted terms to introduce antiquotation (see DESCRIPTION for details).

\SEEALSO
concat, concatl.
