\DOC is_neg_imp

\TYPE {is_neg_imp : (term -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests a term to see if it is an implication or a negation.

\DESCRIBE
{is_neg_imp "t1 ==> t2"} returns {true}. {is_neg_imp "~t"} returns {true}.
If the term is neither an implication nor a negation the result is {false}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
Yields true of negations because {dest_neg_imp} destructs negations (for
compatibility with PPLAMBDA code). This function used to be called {is_imp}.

\SEEALSO
dest_neg_imp, is_imp, dest_imp.
