\TYPE {CHOOSE : ((term # thm) -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates existential quantification using deduction from a
particular witness.

\KEYWORDS
rule, existential.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term-theorem pair {(v,A1 |- ?x. s)} and a second
theorem of the form {A2 u {{s[v/x]}} |- t}, the inference rule {CHOOSE}
produces the theorem {A1 u A2 |- t}.
{
    A1 |- ?x. s[x]    A2 u {{s[v/x]}} |- t
   ---------------------------------------  CHOOSE ("v",(A1 |- ?x. s))
                A1 u A2 |- t
}
\noindent Where {v} is not free in {A2} or {t}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the terms and theorems correspond as indicated above; in
particular, 1) {v} must be a variable and have the same type as the variable
existentially quantified over, and it must not be free in {A2} or {t};
2) the second theorem must have {s[v/x]} in its assumptions.
