The file hol_macros.tex is a collection of macros developed at UC Davis to be
used in placing HOL code in papers. These macros take the (almost) standard
HOL output and convert it into the LaTeX logic symbols (ie. ! is \forall, ? is
\exists, etc.) This is the BETA VERSION (so check the outputs to be safe).

You should redefine '\' as '\\' by "set_lambda`\\.`;; " so LaTeX does not
get confused (HOL still works fine).

We have the following environments:

 \begin{hol} ... \end{hol} Defines an environment for HOL theorems and
                definitions. This environment it identical to alltt except
                that it places a box around the text and ~ still works

 \begin{holnb} ... \end{holnb} Same as ``hol'' but no box

We have the following macros:

 \holthm{defn}  Which takes defn (cut directly from HOL output
                and converts all the symbols (ie. |- ==>) to their
                mathematical equivalents.

 \holdef{defn}  Same as holthm except that the turnstile is subscripted
                by ``def''

I hope you can use these, please send me any comments:
