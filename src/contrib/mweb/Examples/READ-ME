This directory contains a couple of examples of using mweb utilities.
The files having suffix .m are master files. They can be processed by
mweave to generate LaTeX files. 

The file simple.m is a simple example which consists of
a single master file. The latex file generated from it, namely
simple.tex can be formatted directly by LaTeX.

The file lmem.m is another simple example. The LaTeX file generated
from it cannot be formatted directly. It is to be included in a larger
document. The file main.tex is a wrapper to include lmem.tex. This can
serve as a template for other applications.

The LaTeX macro file holmacs.tex used in these examples can be found
in the latex-hol library.
