This directory contains mweb---a suite of utility programs for documenting
and managing HOL srcipt. In fact, it can be used for any programming
languages since it is highly programmable. It is inspired by the idea
of literate programming of D. Knuth. The core of this idea
is to treat programs as works of literature. When programming
in this method, one creates a master file containing both the document
and the program text. This master file is processed by utility
programs to generate program file and document file separately. The
program file is then processed by a compiler or interpreter whilst the
document file is processed by a text formatter to produce human
readable document.

There is a manual in the subdirectory Manual. Both .dvi and PostScript
files of the manual are distributed. If re-format of the manual is
needed, type `make all' in that directory provided you have 
installed all macro files it needs. NOTE: some of these are user
contributions widely available in the TeX/LaTex community but not
distributed with TeX/LaTex system and not installed in every systems.


To re-build the programs type

	make all

in this directory. To install the programs, you may need to change the
system dependent path in the Makefile, and then type

	make install
