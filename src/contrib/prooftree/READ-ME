This directory contains an enhanced subgoal package, called
"prooftree", which allows the user to construct a list of
proof trees. The user thus has a greater power in controlling
the proof process as well as more methods to visualize a
proof.


To load the package, start the HOL session and load the file
"loader" in this directory. To read the documentation, run a
"latex prooftree_doc" in the "doc" directory. The help entries
can be accessed using the xholhelp tool by adding the subdirectory
"help/entries" in the appropriate path.

Please contact me if you have more questions.
