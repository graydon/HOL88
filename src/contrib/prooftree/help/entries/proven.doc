\TYPE {proven : (string -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the theorem proved at a proof tree.

\DESCRIBE
Returns the theorem obtained by applying the solving tactic to the
goal of the given proof tree, usually so that it can be assigned to a
variable. This function does not remove the proof tree from the set of
all proofs. The theorem returned can be used to rewrite other goals or
it can be stored in a theory.

\KEYWORDS
subgoal.

\LIBRARY prooftree

\FAILURE
Fails if there is no proof named by the argument to the function. Also
fails if the top goal of the proof is not yet proved.
