\DOC subgoal_tac

\TYPE {subgoal_tac : (string -> string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints the tactic used in solving the subgoal at the given location.

\DESCRIBE
Part of the enhanced subgoal package, where proofs under development
are stored as trees. The function {show_the_tactic} displays the
whole tactic associated with the proof tree; the function
{subgoal_tac} is more specific in displaying the tactic applied at any
one subtree of the proof tree indicated by the first argument. The
second argument is the path to the root of the subtree for which the
tactic should be printed. Nodes in the subtree in question may be
either proved or unproved.

\KEYWORDS
subgoal

\LIBRARY prooftree

\FAILURE
This function fails if there is no proof tree by the given name or if
the tree does not have a node at the position specified by the second
argument.

\USES
This function is often useful when attempting to solve a similar
subgoal in another part of the proof tree, or even in another proof.

\EXAMPLE
{
# subgoal_tac `myproof` `1.1` ;;

STRIP_TAC
THEN (ASM_REWRITE_TAC [])

() : void
}
