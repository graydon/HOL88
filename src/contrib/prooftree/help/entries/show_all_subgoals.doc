\DOC show_all_subgoals

\TYPE {show_all_subgoals : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Shows the goals of all unexplored nodes in a proof tree.

\DESCRIBE
Part of the enhanced subgoal package, where proofs under development
are stored as trees. The function {show_all_subgoals} lists all the
subgoals which still remain to be proved in the current default proof,
from the  bottom of the stack to the top. Also gives their access
path, which can be used in other function calls such as {do_tac}.

\KEYWORDS
subgoal

\LIBRARY prooftree

\FAILURE
Fails if the given name does not denote a proof tree.

\EXAMPLE
{
# show_all_subgoals `myproof` ;;

1.1.1
"b /\ a"
      ["b"]
      ["a"]

1.2.1
"a /\ b"
      ["a"]
      ["b"]

() : void
}
