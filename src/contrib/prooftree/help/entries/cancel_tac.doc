\DOC cancel_tac

\TYPE {cancel_tac : (string -> string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Marks a node in a {prooftree} as unexplored, and discards the subtree
of the proof under the node.

\DESCRIBE
Facilitates backtracking over a proof tree: marks the indicated node
as unexplored and throws away the subtrees rooted at the node. Unlike
the previous \verb|backup| command, it does not act only on the last
node which was expanded; a tactic at any node can be cancelled. The
first argument indicates the proof tree, the second argument
indicates the node in the proof.

\KEYWORDS
subgoal.

\LIBRARY prooftree

\FAILURE
This function fails when there is no proof tree of the given name or
when the node adressed by the second argument does not exist.

\USES
Allows the user to backtrack over tactics used in a proof. Provides
distinctly more generality than the previous {backup} command.

\EXAMPLE
{
# do_tac `biggie` `1` (EQ_TAC) ;;

new goals:

"a /\ b ==> b /\ a"
"b /\ a ==> a /\ b"

() : void


# e STRIP_TAC ;;

new goals:

"b /\ a"
      ["b"]
      ["a"]

() : void

# cancel_tac `biggie` `1` ;;

"a /\ b = b /\ a"

() : void
}
