\TYPE {rm_proof : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Removes the last proof tree manipulated and releases the space
occupied by it.

\DESCRIBE
Part of the enhanced subgoal package, where proofs under development
are stored as trees. Proof trees can occupy a large amount of computer
space, thus this function may be used to reduce the space overhead.
Once a goal has been proved, or when one decides not to work on it
further, it can be removed from the set of proof trees. It removes the
default proof tree.

\KEYWORDS

\LIBRARY prooftree

\FAILURE
Fails when there is no default proof.
