\DOC current_proof

\TYPE {current_proof : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Displays the proof currently being manipulated.

\DESCRIBE
Part of the enhanced subgoal package, where proofs under development
are stored as trees. The function {current_proof} has the
functionality supplied by the function {print_state} in the inbuilt
subgoal package. The difference is that the proof is pretty-printed,
with goals and tactics displayed in a logical fashion.

\KEYWORDS
subgoal

\LIBRARY prooftree

\FAILURE
Fails when the set of proof trees is empty.

\EXAMPLE
{
#current_proof () ;;

"!a b. a /\ b = b /\ a"
   (STRIP_TAC THEN (STRIP_TAC THEN EQ_TAC))
   "a /\ b ==> b /\ a"
      STRIP_TAC
      "b /\ a"
            [..]
         (REWRITE_TAC [])
         "b /\ a"
               [..]
   "b /\ a ==> a /\ b"
() : void
}
