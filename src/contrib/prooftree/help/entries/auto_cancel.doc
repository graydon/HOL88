\TYPE {auto_cancel : (void -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Allows writing over a previously expanded node in a {prooftree}.

\DESCRIBE
Part of the enhanced subgoal package, where proofs under development
are stored as trees. By default, tactics can only be applied to nodes
marked as unexpanded. To apply a different tactic at a node already
expanded (and maybe already proved) one must first cancel the effect
of the previous tactic. Using {auto_cancel} allows a node to be
re-expanded, at which time the previous proof of the node in question
is discarded.
