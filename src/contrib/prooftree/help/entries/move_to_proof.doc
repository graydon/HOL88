\TYPE {move_to_proof : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Facilitates the transition from one proof to another.

\DESCRIBE
Part of the enhanced subgoal package, where proofs under development
are stored as trees. Multiple incomplete proofs can exist at the same
time, each linked to a different name. The function {move_to_proof} is
used to change the focus of functions such as {current_proof},
{expand}, etc. use the proof pointed at by its argument as the default
one. Usually the default proof is the one which is manipulated last.

\KEYWORDS
subgoal

\LIBRARY prooftree

\FAILURE
Fails when its argument does not name a proof tree.
