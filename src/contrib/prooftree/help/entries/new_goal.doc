\TYPE {new_goal : (string -> goal -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Starts a new named proof tree with a goal.

\DESCRIBE
This is analogous to the previous {set_goal} function, to start a
new proof effort. Here there is a new argument, which gives a name to
the proof being constructed.
When a goal is started with a certain name, previous proof attempts
with that name are removed.

\KEYWORDS
subgoal.

\LIBRARY prooftree

\USES
To set up a new proof tree.

\EXAMPLE
{
# new_goal `myproof` ([], "! a b . ( a /\ b) = ( b /\ a)") ;;

"!a b. a /\ b = b /\ a"

() : void
}
