\TYPE {show_the_tactic : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS

\DESCRIBE
Prints out the tactic-tree currently attached to the proof named by
the argument. The tactics at nodes which still haven't been explored
are indicated by {----}.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is no proof tree with the given name.

\USES
After a proof is completed, {show_the_tactic} can be run to obtain the
complete tactic which can then be stored in a log file for later
re-runs.

\EXAMPLE

{

# show_the_tactic `myproof` ;;

(REPEAT STRIP_TAC)
THEN EQ_TAC
     THENL
     [ STRIP_TAC
       THEN (ASM_REWRITE_TAC []);
       STRIP_TAC
       THEN (ASM_REWRITE_TAC []) ]

() : void
}
