\TYPE {store_thm : (string -> string -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Stores a theorem under the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
When a proof named by the first argument is completed, {store_thm}
applies the resulting tactic on the initial goal and produces a
theorem, which is then stored in a theory with the name given by the
second argument. The function prints out the tactic which was applied
to the goal, and returns the theorem proved, which can then be
assigned to a variable.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is no proof tree with the given name, or if the top
goal of the named proof tree is not proved. It also fails if the
session is not in draft mode, or if there is already a theorem with
the name given by the second argument in the current theory.

\USES
This function accomplishes the same purpose as {save_top_thm} in the
standard subgoal package.

\EXAMPLE
{
# store_thm `myproof` `mythm` ;;
