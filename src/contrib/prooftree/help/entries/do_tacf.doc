\DOC do_tacf

\TYPE {do_tacf : (string -> string -> tactic -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a tactic under the enhanced subgoal package.

\DESCRIBE
Used to apply a tactic the proof pointed by the first argument, at the
node pointed to by the second argument.

\KEYWORDS
subgoal

\LIBRARY prettyp

\FAILURE
See under {do_tac}.

\USES
In practice this function is not very useful in exploring a goal, as
it does not perform a validity check and thus the resulting proof may
not correspond to the original goal. Nevertheless, once a proof is
being re-run it may be faster to use this function.
