Have you ever wanted to run a HOL session non-interactively and have the input
included in the output along with the results?

In this directory, you will find the code for two C programs which allow you
to do just that. `hol_merge' takes the output from a non-interactive HOL
session and merges the original input into it (provided you tell it to use the
right file!) `hol_batch' uses `hol_merge' and presents a simple command to do
batch HOL sessions.

The code may not be very good, but then I'm not really a C programmer.
Any bug reports or improvements would be gratefully received.

I hope you find these programs useful.

                     Richard Boulton (rjb@uk.ac.cam.cl), 11th November 1989.
