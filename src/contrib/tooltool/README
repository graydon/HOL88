     Tooltool is a new way to create windowed applications.  Using existing
applications, and a simple specification language, users can produce
windowed tools with gadgets, mouse actions, and keyboard remapping without
having to learn or use the SunView programming interface.

     To build tooltool, first check a few site dependencies in the Makefile
and in tooltool.c.  These dependencies are:

	In Makefile:
		BINDIR		Where the executable will go, normally
				/usr/local/bin
		MANDIR		Where the man page will go, normally
				/usr/man/manl
		MANEXT		The man page extension, usually 'l',
				for local man pages.  You may want to
				make MANDIR /usr/man/man1, in which case
				MANEXT should be '1'.
		LPR		The complete command you would use to
				print something on your local LaserWriter.
				Typically, this is /usr/ucb/lpr, but you
				might need a different printer name than
				the default.
	In windows.c:
		TOOLTOOL_ICON	Where the tooltool icon can be found.
				Normally, it is in the directory that you
				created tooltool in, but you might want to move
				it to a more global place.  We keep all our
				icons in /usr/local/images, for example.
				Fix this path to match where you put the icon.

You can then build tooltool by typing "make tooltool".  If you wish to try out
the sample applications, cd to samples, and type "../tooltool -f <file>.tt",
where <file>.tt is any of the .tt files in the directory.  See the README
in samples for more information.  When in samples, if you haven't installed
tooltool, you'll need to use "../tooltool" to invoke tooltool.

     Tooltool comes with extensive documentation, which is printed by typing
"make manual".  The manual will emerge from your LaserWriter.  It should print
on either a regular LaserWriter, LaserWriter Plus, or LaserWriter II NT or
NTX.  If you have problems getting it to print, please send e-mail.  If you
do not have a LaserWriter, I'll be glad to mail you hardcopy.  Just send
a request via e-mail or call me.

     I think tooltool opens up a new world of easy application programming.
I am very interested in seeing how others use tooltool, and any comments
or suggestions you may have.  If you send me your e-mail address, I will
keep you up to date with bug fixes, patches, and enhancements.  If you
have a good tooltool file, I'll be glad to distribute it to anyone who
requests it.  In particular, I'd like to see tooltool specs for things
like vi, gnuemacs, various games, and the like.  Bottom line: get on the
tooltool mailing list, and I'll keep you up to date as things progress.

     Many thanks are due the tooltool betatesting team, who perservered
through early releases of this version while I frantically fixed all the
bugs.  The betatesting team was:

	Ian Clowes			Ken Laprade
	Paul J. Emerson			Andy Lord
	Phill Everson			David Masterson
	David Fickes			Neil Movold
	David Forslund			Troy D. Spetz
	Len Jacobs			Larry W. Virden
	Orest Jarosiewicz		C. Philip Wood
	Doug Johnson			Peter Windsor
	Philip Kegelmeyer		Mitchell F. Wyle 	
	Francis Kam

     Please send all bugs, comments, requests, suggestions, and tooltool
files to:

	Chuck Musciano
	Advanced Technology Department
	Harris Corporation
	PO Box 37, MS 3A/1912

I hope you find tooltool useful!
