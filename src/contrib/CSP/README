| DOCUMENTATION:							|
|									|
+ --------------------------------------------------------------------- +

This library contains a basic theory of traces for CSP, as described in
"Communicating Sequential Processes", Hoare C.A.R., Prentice-Hall.

The theories are still unpolished and uncommented.

+ --------------------------------------------------------------------- +
                                      
   0) necessary libraries: string taut sets

   1) edit the pathnames in the Makefile (if necessary)

   2) type "make clean"

   3) type "make all"
