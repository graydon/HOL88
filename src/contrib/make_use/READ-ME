NOTE:
   This contrib submission was developed under HOL88 2.0.

This small utility automatically produces a "theory.use.ml" file
for a theory file "theory.ml".  The .use.ml file will contain
autoloading commands for all of the theorems, axioms and definitions
in the theory.  The advantages of autoloading are enormous - loading
a .use.ml file takes virtually no time at all, and means that you
know that *all* your theorems and definitions will be accessible
*all* the time, without you having to think about it.  This
is even better when the update of .use.ml files is performed
by a makefile.

The facility is used by calling the shell script
  make_use theory

where "theory" is the theory name without the .th extension.

Some notes:
   All libraries used in the theory must have their .th files
soft-linked to the current working directory (This
is how it works for me anyway).
