Description:

The interface consists of the following files:

interp.el - The generalized interpreter functions
xhol.el - The specialization functions.
hol.el - Sets up and electric HOL mode.
init.ml - a sample init.ml file for HOL.
hol-emacs.ps - a postscript file containing the user's manual.

The following changes have been made since the last release:

a.) Electric HOL mode is working now.  
b.) The name of interpreter,el was changed to interp.el because it
didn't work on machines that only support 14 character file names.
c.) A history function was added that records expressions sent to HOL 
in the interaction buffer.  This is toggled by the C-cC-t key
sequence.
d.) The send-buffer command (ESC o) works now.
e.) A command for recentering the interaction buffer was added (C-c C-l).
