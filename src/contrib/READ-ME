| HOL DISTRIBUTION DIRECTORY: contrib                                   |
+ ===================================================================== +

This directory contains contributions from the HOL user community. They are
not edited, and the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory assumes no
responsibility to support any code or tools distributed in this directory.

The aim of contrib is to provide a vehicle to make it easy for the HOL
community to share theories, proofs, examples, tools, documents, and other
material which may be of interest to users of the HOL system, but which is not
included in the library.

Each contribution is given a separate subdirectory within contrib. A standard
READ-ME file is included in each subdirectory, giving at least the following
information:

   * name of the subdirectory
   * a one-line description of the contents
   * names and addresses of the authors,
   * date of inclusion in contrib

Contributors may also include other information in the READ-ME file.

The file CONTENTS contains a brief summary of each entry.
