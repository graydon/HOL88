This directory contains a hol-init file to increase the speed of HOL
when built with AKCL (version 1-615).  AKCL tends to spend half its time
doing garbage collection after being used to build HOL.  The supplied file
increases the allocation of various types of data within lisp, causing
GC to occur less frequently.  Speed-ups tend to be between 1.75 and 2X.
Your mileage may vary.

The file has been tested on Sun4's, DS3100's, and HP snakes.  In order to
make similar mods for another architecture, invoke HOL, and perform the
lisp "room" command.  Here's what it looks like on my Sun4:

   #lisp `(room)`;;
    450/450   54.6% 17 CONS BIGNUM RATIO COMPLEX STRUCTURE NIL
      2/28     6.0%    FIXNUM SHORT-FLOAT CHARACTER RANDOM-STATE READTABLE FAT-STRING
     83/109   97.9%  3 SYMBOL STREAM
      1/2      7.7%    PACKAGE
      2/36     7.9%    ARRAY HASH-TABLE VECTOR BIT-VECTOR PATHNAME
     40/40    30.8%  2 STRING CCLOSURE
     14/17    95.0%    CFUN LONG-FLOAT
      4/5     90.7%    SFUN GFUN CFDATA SPICE NIL

    526/715          4 contiguous (51 blocks)
	125            hole
	33    78.1% 15 relocatable

     596 pages for cells
    1280 total pages
   14121 pages available
     983 pages in heap but not gc'd + pages needed for gc marking
   16384 maximum pages

Now, do exactly what is done for the machines listed in the hol-init file, but
double the size of available CONS cells for the current machine (i.e. from
450 to 900 in this case).

These mods are being shipped as contributed software in this release, but
will probably become part of the standard system next time around (that is if
they don't seem to break the system).  Please send me the configurations for
any new machines, so that they may be included.
