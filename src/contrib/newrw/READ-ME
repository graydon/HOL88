One of the differences between HOL2.0 and HOL2.01 is that the function
previously called REWRITE_CONV is now called REWR_CONV.
This has allowed the introduction of rewriting conversions analagous
to the existing rewrite rules and tactics.

The shell script newrw in this directory can be used to subsitute instances
of REWRITE_CONV with REWR_CONV in your ml files to help you update them
to HOL2.01.

Here are the expanatory comments from newrw.
# This file is used to help update ml files from HOL2.0 to HOL2.01
# usage: newrw file.ml
# It replaces instances of REWRITE_CONV in file.ml with REWR_CONV.
# A copy of the original version of the file is saved in file.ml.old
# An alternative usage for newrw is as follows:
# usage: newrw file.ml target replacement
# When used in this way newrw replaces instances of target in file.ml by
# replacement.
# newrc checks that replacement does not already appear in file.ml
