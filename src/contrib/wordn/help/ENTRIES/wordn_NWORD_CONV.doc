\TYPE {wordn_NWORD_CONV : conv}

\LIBRARY wordn

\SYNOPSIS
Derives a theorem stating the  representation of a natural number in
an n-bit word.

\DESCRIBE
{wordn_NWORD_CONV} takes a term in the form {"NWORDn m"} and derives a
theorem stating the n-bit word representing the natural number {m} as
below:
{
	|- NWORDn m = #...
}
If {m} is greater than the maximium that an n-bit word can represent,
{m MOD (2 EXP n)} will be used to work out the n-bit word instead. By
virtue of the theorem returned by {prove_NWORD_MOD}, the above theorem
is still valid.

\FAILURE
Fails if the type {:wordn} or the function {NWORDn} has not been defined.

\EXAMPLE
The HOL session below illustrates the use of this conversion:
{
   # wordn_NWORD_CONV "NWORD3 6";;
   |- NWORD3 6 = #110

   # wordn_NWORD_CONV "NWORD3 16";;
   |- NWORD3 16 = #000
}
