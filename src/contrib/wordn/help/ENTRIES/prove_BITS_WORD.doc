\TYPE {prove_BITS_WORD : thm -> thm}

\LIBRARY wordn

\SYNOPSIS
Proves a theorem for reducing {BITSn(WORDn [...])} to {[...]}.

\DESCRIBE
{prove_BITS_WORDS} takes a theorem returned by {define_wordn_type} and
deduces a theorem which is an instance of the second conjunct of the
type definition theorem. This theorem is usually used in rewriting to
simplify terms containing the expression {BITSn(WORDn [...]}. 

\FAILURE
Fails if the input theorem is not in the expected form.

\EXAMPLE
{prove_BITS_WORD word3} where {word3} is the theorem 
{
   |- (!w. WORD3(BITS3 w) = w) /\
      (!l. (LENGTH l = 3) = (BITS3(WORD3 l) = l))
}
\noindent returns the following theorem:
{
   |- !b0 b1 b2. BITS3(WORD3[b0; b1; b2]) = [b0; b1; b2]
}
