\TYPE {wordn_NVAL_CONV : conv}

\LIBRARY wordn

\SYNOPSIS
Derives a theorem stating the value of a word.

\DESCRIBE
{wordn_NVAL_CONV} takes a term in the form {"NVALn #..."} and derives
a theorem stating the value of the given word when interpreted as
natural number in a big-endian format. The length of the string
following the hash {#} should be {n}, and it should consist of only
the digits {0} and {1}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the type {:wordn} or the constant {NVALn} has not been
defined, or the string is not in the form specified above.

\EXAMPLE
The HOL session below illustrates the use of this conversion:
{
   # let word3_val_6 = wordn_NVAL_CONV "NVAL3 #110";;
   word3_val_6 = |- NVAL3 #110 = 6
}
