\label{theorems}

The sections that follow list all theorems in the \ml{wordn} library, including
definitions. The theorems are grouped into sections according to 
the theory segment in which they are stored.
 The reader may therefore have to consult
more than one section when searching for any particular theorem.

When the \ml{wordn} library is loaded, all the theorems listed in this chapter
(including definitions) are set up to autoload when their names are mentioned
in \ML.
