The C utility "holsort" in this directory makes it easy to look up
information contained in theories -- particularly large theories
prepared by people other than yourself -- by producing
alphabetically-ordered versions of files containing lists of HOL
axioms, theorems, definitions, or constants with associated type
declarations.  The files that "holsort" takes as input can be prepared
easily with the UNIX command "script" and the HOL commands
"print_theory", "axioms", "theorems", and so on.  See comments in
"holsort.c" for more specific information about how the program
operates, how to invoke it, and how to compile it.

Happy sorting, and please send me any reports of problems or
possible improvements.
