The contents of this directory are as follows:

    sys.ml      -- loads the files in the right order
    lib.ml      -- auxiliary function definitions, some of general interest
    rewrite.ml  -- rewriting sans conversions - not as general, 
                   but often faster.
    kb.ml       -- implements Knuth-Bendix completion
    order.ml    -- term orderings a la Dershowitz
    group.ml    -- the standard tests (from the original KB paper)
    paper.tex   -- an explanatory paper

The paper is absolutely standard latex. To run the system, load sys.ml into
hol88 and try the tests given at the end of group.ml. All files have varying
(usually small) amounts of documentation. Reference is made to the relevant
papers at the heads of the relevant files.
