This case study is supported by the files in the directory, protocols,
in the HOL distribution directory.  These files are :


READ-ME

casestudy.tex	sect1.tex 	sect2.tex	sect3.tex	appendix.tex
casestudy.dvi   cshead.tex

SWnew.ml	SW.th

hdi_tli.ml	plusm_subm.ml	int.ml		mod.ml		da.ml
hdi_tli.th	plusm_subm.th	int.th		mod.th		da.th
arith.ml	arith.th	myarith.ml	myarith.th

tacticsSW.ml	mytactics.ml

startSW.ml	restartSW.ml	tydefsSW.ml

MakeSW		MakeEverything


The file READ-ME contains this explanation.  The .tex files are needed
to print the casestudy document, and casestudy.dvi is its output form.
SWnew.ml contains the HOL sessions in this document and SW.th contains
a copy of the theory which is created by executing SWnew.ml.

The remaining .ml and .th files support the main sliding window protocol
theory.  MakeSW automatically performs the HOL session described in the
case study, and MakeEverything rebuilds the complete supporting theory
as well.  MakeEverything should not be used if it can be avoided, as
the sessions involved will take a very long time.

The HOL files used in this case study have been updated to run in HOL12
and the text updated to match the new files
