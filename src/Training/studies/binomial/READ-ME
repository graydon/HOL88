Makefile                        make file for the theories
                                Contains a macro Hol that you should set
                                to start your local version of the system.

hol-init.ml                     Theory loading utilities used by other ML files

mk_BINOMIAL.ml                  ML to prove the Binomial Theorem
BINOMIAL.th                     Theory generated by mk_BINOMIAL.ml
BINOMIAL.ml                     ML to load the theory BINOMIAL.th

mk_BINOMIAL_integer.ml          ML to specialise the theorem to the integers
BINOMIAL_integer.th             Theory generated by mk_BINOMIAL_integer.ml
BINOMIAL_integer.ml             ML to load the theory BINOMIAL_integer.th

In a shell, say
    (latex root; latex root)    to make the documentation, file root.dvi
    make BINOMIAL               to make the theory BINOMIAL.th
    make BINOMIAL_integer       to make the theory BINOMIAL_integer.th

In a fresh HOL session, say
    loadf `BINOMIAL`;;          to load the theory BINOMIAL.th and declare
                                its theorems and definitions as ML identifiers
    loadf `BINOMIAL_integer`;;  ditto for the theory BINOMIAL_integer.th
